# Hands on with CI/CD with Jenkins Pipeline
## Overview

Jenkins is, fundamentally, an automation engine which supports a number of automation patterns. Pipeline adds a powerful set of automation tools onto Jenkins, supporting use cases that span from simple continuous integration to comprehensive CD pipelines. By modeling a series of related tasks, users can take advantage of the many features of Pipeline:

Code: Pipelines are implemented in code and typically checked into source control, giving teams the ability to edit, review, and iterate upon their delivery pipeline.

Durable: Pipelines can survive both planned and unplanned restarts of the Jenkins master.

Pausable: Pipelines can optionally stop and wait for human input or approval before continuing the Pipeline run.

Versatile: Pipelines support complex real-world CD requirements, including the ability to fork/join, loop, and perform work in parallel.

Extensible: The Pipeline plugin supports custom extensions to its DSL [1] and multiple options for integration with other plugins.
